# Assignment 1
In this assignment, I have done some basic cleaning and transformation functions. In the orders table, the postal code was 80 % empty. Hence, I have changed the Data Type to Text and imputed "Unknown" in all the null values and valid became 100%. In the people table, the column headers were not correct and I have changed the headers by tapping on the "Use First Row as Headers". Also, there were some null values and I have deleted all the rows with null values in all the columns of the rows by selecting the option "Remove Blank Rows". In the returns table,  the column headers were not correct and I have changed the headers by tapping on the "Use First Row as Headers".
I have also attached the screenshots of the uncleaned dataset.
# Assignment 2
This file contains work for Assignment 2, showcasing various DAX operations in Power BI to analyze and manipulate sales transaction data from a global retail store dataset. In this project, I applied functions like ADD COLUMN, SELECT COLUMN, DIVIDE, IF, STDEV.P, SUM, SUMX, and ROUND to create new columns and measures, perform calculations, and enhance data insights. Year-to-date calculations were implemented using the YTD function, and the YEAR function was used to extract and analyze time-based information. The assignment demonstrates core DAX skills, including creating new tables, applying conditional logic, rounding data, and managing aggregates to generate meaningful reports, which are stored in Assignment 2.pbix
