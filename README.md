# Assignment 1
In this assignment, I have done some basic cleaning and transformation functions. In the orders table, the postal code was 80 % empty. Hence, I have changed the Data Type to Text and imputed "Unknown" in all the null values and valid became 100%. In the people table, the column headers were not correct and I have changed the headers by tapping on the "Use First Row as Headers". Also, there were some null values and I have deleted all the rows with null values in all the columns of the rows by selecting the option "Remove Blank Rows". In the returns table,  the column headers were not correct and I have changed the headers by tapping on the "Use First Row as Headers".
I have also attached the screenshots of the uncleaned dataset.
# Assignment 2
This file contains work for Assignment 2, showcasing various DAX operations in Power BI to analyze and manipulate sales transaction data from a global retail store dataset. In this project, I applied functions like ADD COLUMN, SELECT COLUMN, DIVIDE, IF, STDEV.P, SUM, SUMX, and ROUND to create new columns and measures, perform calculations, and enhance data insights. Year-to-date calculations were implemented using the YTD function, and the YEAR function was used to extract and analyze time-based information. The assignment demonstrates core DAX skills, including creating new tables, applying conditional logic, rounding data, and managing aggregates to generate meaningful reports, which are stored in Assignment 2.pbix
# Asignment 3
In this assignment, I have created Sales report that provides insights into sales, profit, and different metrics. The Home Page serves as an overview, displaying Sales, Discount and Profit along with three slicers that allow users to filter data dynamically for better analysis. Additionally, I have designed four dedicated visualization pages, each focusing on specific aspects of the data. These include sales trends, profit analysis, the impact of discounts, and a comparative view of performance metrics. 
# Power BI Capstone Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed for a trading company. It utilizes a dataset with columns such as Product, Discount Band, Units Sold, Manufacturing Price, Sale Price, Gross Sales, Discounts, Sales, COGS, Profit, Date, Month Number, Month Name, and Year. The dashboard is divided into two key pages: the Home Page and the Visualisations Page, each serving a unique purpose to analyze and visualize the company's sales and profitability data.

## Home Page
1) Purpose: Provides an overview with key numerical insights.
2) Components: Slicers: Enable dynamic filtering of data for granular analysis.
3) Gauge and Cards: Display important numerical values such as total sales, profit, and discounts without any visualizations.
4) Buttons: Navigate to the Visualisations Page.
Clear all selections made in the slicers for a refreshed view.
5) Logo: A small company logo added to the top left corner for branding.

## Visualisations Page
1) Purpose: Offers detailed and interactive visualizations for deeper insights.
2) Visuals Included: Stacked Column Chart: Displays units sold by product and segments.
3) Pie Chart: Represents profit distribution by country.
4) Line and Stacked Column Chart: Shows units sold, profit, and country trends.
5) Map: Visualizes profit by country and segment.
6) Tree Map: Highlights gross sales by segments.
7) Matrix: Combines products, segments, and selling prices in a tabular format.
8) Funnel Chart: Identifies high-profit-selling products.
9) Navigation Button: Allows users to return to the Home Page.

# Navigation Workflow
## Home Page:

Start with slicers to filter data.
View key metrics in cards and the gauge visual.
Navigate to the next page (Visualisations) using the provided button.
Clear filters as needed using the "Clear All Selections" button.

## Visualisations Page:

Explore detailed data insights through various charts and visuals.
Return to the Home Page using the navigation button.
## Key Highlights
- Interactive Design: User-friendly interface with slicers, buttons, and visuals that respond dynamically to selections.
- Clear Navigation: Intuitive buttons for seamless movement between pages and resetting filters.
- Comprehensive Analysis: Visualizations tailored to highlight key aspects such as sales, profit, and segment performance.
